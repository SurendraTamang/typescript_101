## The compiler

Typical steps of compiler is below
- Programmer writes the program
- Program is parsed to AST(Abstract Syntax Tree)
- AST is compiled to bytecode
- Bytecode is evaluated by the runtime

In case of Typescript, it compiles to JavaScript, before going to AST it make sure it checked the types and typesafety
